### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vatsal

I'm a **2nd year** undergraduate at **VIT Vellore** exploring my passion for **data science and machine learning.**

I love coding up statistics, ML models and neural networks to unlock insights. My goal is to unravel some of AI's mysteries through hands-on projects.

Outside of data world, I enjoy strumming my **guitar**, reading **mythology novels**, **playing games**, **stargazing** and **hanging out with fascinating minds.**

Over time, I hope this profile becomes a window into my adventures **cracking codes**, **doing math**, and building **smart systems with data**. Feel free to poke around my repositories and projects!

I'd love to hear about what fascinates you, or **collaborate** on something **data/AI related.** **Don't hesitate to reach out!**
